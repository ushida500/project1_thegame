##DEVELOPMENT: TECH, WEB AND MORE

###HTML and CSS
HTML was used to develop the basic structure of the game, like the buttons and the counters. CSS helped in making it visually appealing through color and texture, also in the positioning of the different elements. 

###Javascript and JQuery
The secret to make the game dynamic is to add Javascript functions and a jQuery library. Find the library [here](https://code.jquery.com/)

Using this languages, I was able to build a game that hide and show the elements, make images clickable, include different events (actions or effects) through the game, manage the score, switch the players turns and much more!
