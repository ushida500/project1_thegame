###Simple, fun and challenging (just to escape from the boring daily commuting or waiting in the doctor's office!)
Designed for one or two players, this game is about using your memory to pick the same images in less than 10 seconds, and make a match (or several). The player that get more matches will be the winner. So almost everybody likes a good, colorful, and fresh veggie. [Play it!](https://ushida500.github.io/project1_thegame/)

##DEVELOPMENT: TECH, WEB AND MORE

###HTML and CSS
HTML was used to develop the basic structure of the game, like the buttons and the counters. CSS helped in making it visually appealing through color and texture, also in the positioning of the different elements. 

###Javascript and JQuery
The secret to make the game dynamic is to add Javascript functions and a jQuery library. Find the library [here](https://code.jquery.com/)

Using this languages, I was able to build a game that hide and show the elements, make images clickable, include different events (actions or effects) through the game, manage the score, switch the players turns and much more!
